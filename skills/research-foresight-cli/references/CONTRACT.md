# ARA World Model — Engine Contract (the shared interface)

## CLI-only access boundary

Every knowledge-layer or root `PAPER.md` read/write in this page uses `ara -C <artifact>`; the
words read, open, search, write, append and edit retain their original procedural meaning,
but never authorize direct knowledge-file tools. Run one quoted `ara` command per shell call,
with no pipes, redirects, `&&`, `;` or globs, and read brief text: `ls`, `find`, then `show`
the address the output prints, and cite that address. `cli-access.md` covers bounds, misses
and the exact-source read before a guarded write;
`ls`, `find`, `show --with path,refs`, `ls --unfinished` and `status` are access aids, not semantic judgments.
Source/evidence bodies and skill pages remain direct only within the baseline scope.
No direct fallback, automatic semantic retry, new role, or altered stopping rule is allowed.
The entrypoint loads `references/cli-access.md` directly for executable wire details.
Pending protocol review and binary proof remain visible in the variant lock.

## 0. First principles

1. **The ARA is the substrate.** The engine reads an ARA's native knowledge files **through ara** (full native source bodies) — there is
   no projection step, no intermediate distilled database, and no global-ID scheme. The ARA produced by the compiler
   (`PAPER.md`, `logic/`, `trace/`, `evidence/`, `src/`) is already a structured, machine-readable
   artifact; the World Model reasons over *that*, not over a lossy copy of it. Grounding is the
   ARA's own native anchors (§2), used verbatim.

2. **Field-agnostic.** The engine knows the ARA's *structure*, never its domain. Which quantity is
   the objective, whether more is better, and what any domain term means arrive as **data in the
   ARA's own text** (the `problem.md` objective, the method, the evidence) — never from a rule in
   the engine, and never from your own priors about the field. The same engine works on a biology
   ARA, an HCI ARA, anything.

3. **Agentic core.** The two contracts (`RETRIEVE.md`, `PREDICT.md`) are **agentic**: each reads
   the ARA's prose and reasons over it. There is **no deterministic projection or distance layer**; `ara find` may aid retrieval
   but never rank semantic relevance or replace grounding. Relevance and inference are semantic, over the ARA's real prose.

4. **Native-ref grounding.** Every assertion a contract makes carries one or more **native refs**
   into the ARA (§2) — used verbatim, with **no minted IDs**: trace node `trace:N109`; claim
   `logic/claims.md#C05`; concept `logic/concepts.md#<name>`; method/problem `<file path>#<section>`;
   evidence `evidence/.../<file>.md`. A ref promises the cited location actually contains the claim.

5. **Grounded answering over the ARA.** The Predictor reads the ARA and **answers any question
   grounded in it** — predictive, explanatory, comparative, evaluative, or anything else; it separates
   `grounded_inference` from a named `speculative_leap` and commits to a checkable point. The engine
   is **read-only** (§4b).

## 1. Engine layout

```
research-foresight-cli/              # ENGINE — the skill, all-English contracts, no per-ARA data
  SKILL.md                           # entry point: retrieve precedent, then answer the question
  references/
    CONTRACT.md                      # this file — the foundation both contracts bind to
    RETRIEVE.md                      # agentic retrieval over ONE ARA's native files
    PREDICT.md                       # grounded answerer over one ARA — any question shape

<ara_dir>/                           # THE SUBSTRATE — knowledge via ara full source reads, never copied or projected
  PAPER.md                           # the narrative
  logic/                             # claims.md, concepts.md, problem.md, experiments.md,
                                     #   related_work.md, and solution/* (the actual method layer)
  trace/                             # exploration_tree.yaml — the FULL DAG:
                                     #   experiment, dead_end, question, decision, pivot
  evidence/                          # figures/, tables/, ... — grounded evidence
  src/                               # code / configs / data as the work warrants
```

The engine carries no data and no per-ARA config: it operates on a bare `<ara_dir>`, builds no
intermediate distilled database, and has no write path (§4b). Keyword retrieval is only an access aid.

## 2. Grounding references

Grounding is the ARA's **native anchors**, used **verbatim** — no minting, no `<scheme>://…` strings.
Every assertion a contract emits carries one or more of these refs:

| what is referenced | native ref form | example |
|---|---|---|
| trace node | `trace:<Nxx>` | `trace:N109` |
| claim | `logic/claims.md#<Cxx>` | `logic/claims.md#C05` |
| concept | `logic/concepts.md#<name>` | `logic/concepts.md#warmup-schedule` |
| method / problem | `<file path>#<section>` | `logic/solution/method.md#step-3`, `logic/problem.md#objective` |
| evidence | `evidence/.../<file>.md` | `evidence/figures/figure3.md` |

**Ref-honesty rule.** A ref is a *promise* that the cited location actually contains the claim it is
attached to. A contract may not attach a ref it has not read and confirmed; an assertion with no
resolvable ref is not allowed (§4a).

**Multi-ARA hook (design only, not built now).** Single-ARA refs are the zero-prefix case — in single-ARA operation the prefix is simply omitted: `trace:N109`, `logic/claims.md#C05`. A later
multi-ARA layer disambiguates by ARA name (`<ara_name>:trace:N109`); the contracts say "the ARA in
scope", so no field is renamed to add it.

---

## 3. What each contract reads and writes

| contract | reads | writes |
|---|---|---|
| `RETRIEVE.md` | the ARA's native knowledge via ara (`logic/`, `trace/`, `PAPER.md`); permitted `evidence/` and `src/` bodies directly | **nothing** |
| `PREDICT.md` | the `retrieval` object from `RETRIEVE.md` + the bodies of every ref it cites | **nothing** — its `Answer` output may carry a `contradiction_report` (PREDICT.md §7): sanctioned *output* for the caller to transport, not a write |

`RETRIEVE.md` is **not** limited to `experiment`/`dead_end` nodes — `question`/`decision`/`pivot`
nodes, `problem.md` framing, the `solution/` method, and evidence figures are all in scope and are
often the highest-value context.

---

## 4. Invariants

These bind every module; a contract that cannot satisfy one must say so rather than violate it.

a. **Forced native-ref grounding.** Every assertion a contract emits carries one or more native
   refs (§2) that resolve into the ARA in scope. No resolvable ref ⇒ the assertion is not made.

b. **The engine never writes.** Every contract (`RETRIEVE.md`, `PREDICT.md`) produces output only;
   the World Model writes nothing into the ARA — not `logic/`, not `trace/`, not `staging/`, nowhere.
   Write-back into the ARA's canonical `logic/` is owned by the ARA's own `research-manager`.

c. **No domain branching.** No rule or inference keys on a domain, metric, or parameter name;
   domain specifics enter only as data read from the ARA in scope.

d. **Honest disclosure.** Uncertainty is disclosed, never suppressed: the Retriever lowers its
   coverage verdict when the ARA does not cover the query, and the Predictor lowers confidence
   for any answer beyond what its cited refs support — a low-confidence bold answer is allowed;
   a confident ungrounded one is not.
